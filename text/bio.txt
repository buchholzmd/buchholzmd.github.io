<p>
I'm a PhD candidate in the department of Computer Science at the University of British Columbia, co-advised by 
<a href=https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~schmidtm/>Mark Schmidt</a>, 
<a href=https://djsutherland.ml/>Danica Sutherland</a>, 
and <a href=https://geoffpleiss.com/>Geoff Pleiss</a>. 
My research focuses on the mathematics of deep learning, 
using tools from applied harmonic and functional analysis, high-dimensional probability, and stochastic analysis 
to understand approximation, optimization dynamics, and generalization in overparameterized models and neural networks.

<p>Previously, I completed a Master's in Mathematics at the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences at NYU, where I was advised by 
<a href=https://cims.nyu.edu/~gunturk/>Sinan Güntürk</a>
and <a href=https://cims.nyu.edu/~bruna/>Joan Bruna</a>.
Before that, I received my BS in Computer Science and BA in Physics with a minor in Mathematics from 
California State University, Long Beach (2021), where I worked with <a href=https://home.csulb.edu/~wzhang2/>Wenlu Zhang</a>.
I also spent 2 years as a Machine Learning Engineer at Samsung Research America with the Think Tank Team 
working under Rehmi Post on a variety of scientific and engineering problems involving
Computational Imaging, Fourier Optics, Inverse Rendering, Signal Processing, Audio Analysis and Synthesis, and Video Analysis.</p>

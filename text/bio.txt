<p>I'm a Master's candidate in Mathematics at the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences at NYU. I am 
completing a Master's thesis advised by <a href=https://cims.nyu.edu/~gunturk/>Sinan Güntürk</a> 
on the approximation capacity of deep neural networks.</p>

<p>My research focus is on applying tools from
functional and harmonic analysis, 
probability theory and stochastic processes, 
and optimal transport theory in developing a mathematical theory of neural networks.
I am also interested in the foundations of Bayesian deep learning and generative models, and how both can be applied to solve Inverse Problems.</p>

<p>I received my BS in Computer Science and BA in Physics with a Minor in Mathematics from 
California State University, Long Beach (2021). 

During this time, I worked with <a href=https://home.csulb.edu/~wzhang2/>Wenlu Zhang</a> in the <a href=http://csulb-ml.github.io/>Deep Learning Lab (LBDL)</a> 
where we explored the intersection between Gaussian processes, recurrent networks, and attention mechanisms for time-series analysis 
in collaboration with CSULB's <a href="https://www.csulb.edu/shark-lab">Shark Lab</a>, leading to a <a href=https://kdd-milets.github.io/milets2021/papers/MiLeTS2021_paper_13.pdf>KDD 2021 Workshop Paper</a>. 

We also applied functional data analysis and transfer learning for anomaly detection in thermal images for 3D printing.</p>

<p>After graduating, I spent 2 years as a Machine Learning Engineer at Samsung Research America with the Think Tank Team 
working under Rehmi Post on a variety of scientific and engineering problems involving
Computational Imaging, Fourier Optics, Inverse Rendering, Signal Processing, Audio Analysis and Synthesis, and Video Analysis. </p>
